The project should follow a new naming scheme.

The project itself is still called "ractor-wormhole".
What is currently the "gateway" will be renamed to Nexus.
There will be one Nexus that holds multiple Portals.
Connection (may sometimes be called channel in the code) will be renamed to Portal.
One Portal (in a Nexus) connects to another Portal (in a remote Nexus, this is an actor remote communication library) through a Conduit.
The Conduit is the connection between two portals - currently there is one implementation based on Websockets.

Messages are Immaterialized on the sending side (serialized) and Rematerialized on the receiving side (deserialized) when passing through portals.


Please refactor the codebase to implement the following naming scheme changes:

1. Rename "gateway" to "nexus" (maintaining proper case sensitivity - Gateway → Nexus)
2. Rename "connection" to "portal" (maintaining proper case sensitivity - Connection → Portal)
3. Keep "conduit" as is
4. Introduce terminology for message passing as "immaterialization" (sending) and "rematerialization" (receiving)

Apply these changes consistently across:
- Struct/enum names and their fields
- Function/method names
- Variable names
- Type parameters
- Documentation comments
- README and other markdown files
- Module names and references

Maintain code functionality while updating all identifiers and terminology.
Also update any conceptual explanations in comments to use the new terminology consistently.
